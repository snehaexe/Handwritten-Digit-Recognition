# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
During my internship at CodeClause, I have completed my assigned project on Handwritten Digit Recognition.
Working with the MNIST dataset allowed me to learn the principles of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a particular kind of deep neural network. I learned how to use the Keras library to apply deep learning, how to build a CNN model—which typically consists of convolutional and pooling layers—why CNN works best with grid structures, and other things while working on this project.  

## About the Dataset:
The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, or MNIST dataset, is one of the most well-liked datasets for machine learning and deep learning. It has 10,000 test photos and about 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The handwritten digit pictures are represented as a 28 by 28 matrix with grayscale pixel values in each cell. simply a tensor of numbers in the range [0, 255] as picture. Near to 255 is considered dark the closer it comes to zero. Consequently, it has ten separate classifications.
